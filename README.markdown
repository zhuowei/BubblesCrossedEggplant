Yet another (Lisp-like) calculator.

Made because @LemonPi made a Scheme interpreter, and I wanted to know how one could make something like that. I was too lazy to make it actually run code, though, so I only implemented the easy parts.

Supported built-in methods and constants:

```
+
-
*
/
define
quote
lambda
display
if
eq?
nil
```

(Not all of these work properly)
